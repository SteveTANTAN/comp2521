comment:

1. Under the same condition, the average time for 
using Sort Program is always smaller than the average 
time for using IntList Program.

2. As the number of data increases, no matter which 
method, the program running time shows an increasing 
trend. 
Since the amount of computations increase.

3. The running time of programs would not be affected 
by data duplication.

4. For both programs, the running time of the random 
sequence is always larger than the running time of 
the sorted sequence or reverse sequence. 
Since, for the sorted and reverse sequence, the number 
only needs to be inserted before the head of list or after 
the end of list, so the time complexity of algorithm is O(1).
But for the random sequence, the number needs to be inserted
by using the loop, so its time complexity of algorithm is O(n/2).
therefore, it needs more time.
